This is my first post with a first test:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end
print_hello('World')
#=> prints 'Hello, World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Meanwhile you can visit my [twitter](https://twitter.com/gabamnml) account so you know I'm not just a robot.
