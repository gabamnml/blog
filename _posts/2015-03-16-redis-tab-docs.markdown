I create my first App in Swift for OSX, hope you enjoy it and will be helpful.

## Support 
GUI for Start/Stop Redis Server and Open CLI. 

Disclaimer: only runs on OSX & if your config of Redis locate in "/usr/local/etc/redis.conf" by default. (Most likely that if you installed _Redis_ with _Homebrew_ this is the route to use.)

## How to install
Download the latest version of App in this [link](https://l.garamburu.com/redis-tab-app) open _RedisTab.dmg_ and drag in your Applications folder.

## How to use
Open _RedisTab.App_ locate in Applications folder and just that :)

This creates a StatusMenu (the icon next to the date time) section where you can manage App, see the documentation and open the CLI
